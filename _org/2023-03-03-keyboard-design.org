* Keyboard design

** Overview
This keyboard is based on the power of esp32 ecosystem and qmk
architecture. By borrowing and learning from both communities to
create a keyboard that can be used as a efficiency booster. So the
hardware is based on esp32, which has many connection options and
complete application layer software. The keyboard OS is FreeRTOS. It
is a reliable real time OS. The keyboard can be connected to many
devices through three methods.
. USB (For power and keyboard functionality)
. BLE (For keyboard functionality)
. Wifi (For status review and keyboard configuration)
The keyboard is powered by USB. In the future I will add battery
support. Using USB power is a easy start.

The keyboard layout should be user friendly. The key can be reached
easily without paying too much attention. And it is more easily
accepted by normal users.

** Hardware Components
The hardware includes PCB, stablizier, case, LED, buzzer. And off
couse there are switches, keycaps. The keyboard supports hot-swap
sockets. Users are allowed to change the switches and keycaps.

** Software Functionalities
*** Basic Functionalities
- Power On and Off
  + Show Running Status: Active, Idle, Current Power Source, etc.
  If the keyboard is powered by USB, you can power on the keyboard
  by connecting keyboard to a USB port through a USB Type-A to Type-C
  cable. You can power off the keyboard by disconnecting the cable. If
  the keyboard is powered by batteries. The keyboard will enter idle
  mode if it is idle for 5 seconds. You don't need to manually turn it
  off to save power. But if you want to manually turn it off you can
  take out the batteries from the battery case. When you put in
  batteries the keyboard is powered on automatically.
- Manage Connections
  + Choose Whether to Send Keys through USB Connection
    As required by the USB protocol we have to provide the device
    information when you connect a HID device to computer or any hub we
    have to identify the keyboard as a keyboard. So when you
    connect this keyboard to computer the connection is
    established. But since we have other connection options we can
    choose whether to send key codes through this connection.
  + BLE Functionality
    * Turn On BLE
    * Turn Off BLE
    * Reset Bondings
    * Connection Management
  + Turn On Wifi and Web Server
